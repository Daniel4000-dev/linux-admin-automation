# Creating the Pre-Commit Hook
- In my git repo I navigated to the `.git/hooks`
- Created a pre-commit hook script
```bash
touch pre-commit
nano pre-commit
```
- In the text editor i added this script to check for syntax errors in the `.sh` files
```bash
#!/bin/bash

# Run syntax check on all .sh files staged for commit
for file in $(git diff --cached --name-only --diff-filter=ACM | grep -E '\.sh$'); do
    bash -n "$file"
    if [ $? -ne 0 ]; then
        echo "Syntax error in $file, commit aborted."
        exit 1
    fi
done

# If no syntax errors, continue with the commit
exit 0
```
- Made the script executeable
```bash
chmod +x .git/hooks/pre-commit
```
